## Bag Files Notes
The bag files macfirst_floor_take_1 and macfirst_floor_take_2 bag files are provided by the teaching team and used to test our particle filter in the mac_1st_floor_final.yaml map.

The bag file bag_file_demo_1 was generated by running our particle filter with the bag file macfirst_floor_take_1 and the map mac_1st_floor_final.yaml. 

The bag file bag_file_demo_2 was generated by running our particle filter with the bag file macfirst_floor_take_2 and the map mac_1st_floor_final.yaml. 

The runs of the particle filters that resulted in the demo bag files show that our particle filter has good location accuracy, but strugles with heading/theta accuracy. The esitimated x,y position of the robot in these bag files is consistently accurate, but the estimated heading changes dramatically and is often inaccurate. We also observed that our particle filter gets most confused in open areas, such as where the hallway meets a deep nook. This makes sense, as obstacles are further away and lidar measurements are less acurrate in these locations.
